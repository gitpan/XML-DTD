XML/DTD version 0.11
====================

This package consists of the XML::DTD Perl module as well as
supporting modules, and the dtdto script which makes use of 
the module to parse a DTD and construct an XML representation, 
from which DTD documentation may be generated in HTML or 
Docbook formats by the included XSL transforms.

There should be no machine dependencies as the module is 
written purely in Perl.
